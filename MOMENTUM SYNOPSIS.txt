

Here's a 10-week synopsis for the MOMENTUM app, with a focus on a different theme and goal for each week.

---

### **Week 1: The First Step**

**Goal:** Establish the foundation.

This week is all about starting. Pick just **one habit**, no matter how small, and commit to logging it every single day. The focus isn't on perfection; it's on building the crucial habit of **using the app**. Aim for your first 7-day streak.

---

### **Week 2: Building Your Streak**

**Goal:** Create consistency.

You've made it through the first week! Now, the mission is to defend your streak at all costs. Don't worry about "quality" just yet. If you only have time for a one-minute meditation, that's still a success. The power is in **not breaking the chain**.

---

### **Week 3: The First Test**

**Goal:** Push through resistance.

This is where the initial motivation can start to fade. You might feel lazy or forget a day. This is the moment to remember your "why." If you miss a day, use the **app's check-in feature** to get right back on track. Acknowledge the slip-up and move on immediately.

### **Week 4: The Milestone**

**Goal:** Lock in a month of progress.

Congratulations, you've hit your first major milestone! You are now a month in. This week is for celebrating your achievement. Look at your **app's calendar view** and see all the green circles. This is tangible evidence of your commitment and will motivate you to continue.

---

### **Week 5: The "Why" behind the Habit**

**Goal:** Connect your habit to your identity.

Itâ€™s no longer about just checking a box. This week, we go deeper. In the **notes section**, write down a few sentences about how the habit is positively affecting your life. This reinforces the behavior by tying it to a personal benefit.

---

### **Week 6: Adjust and Optimize**

**Goal:** Make the habit more effective.

The habit should now feel like a natural part of your routine. This week, think about how to make it even better. Maybe you can increase the duration or add a small ritual to make it more enjoyable. Use the app's **editing feature** to adjust your habit description.

---

### **Week 7: Stack Your Habits**

**Goal:** Make it automatic.

This is where you make the habit unstoppable. Think about a habit you already do automatically (like making your morning coffee or brushing your teeth). Now, "stack" your new habit on top of it. Use a note to write: "**After I [existing habit], I will [new habit]**."

---

### **Week 8: The Non-Negotiable**

**Goal:** Turn it into a core routine.

Your habit is no longer something you "try" to do; it's something you **just do**. It's now a fundamental part of your day, like eating or sleeping. This week is about embracing that fact and making sure nothing gets in the way of your new routine.

---

### **Week 9: Reflect and Refine**

**Goal:** See how far you've come.

Take a few moments this week to reflect on your journey. What was the hardest part? What surprised you? The app's **data insights** can show you how many days you've completed your habit and the consistency you've built over time.

---

### **Week 10: Mastery and Expansion**

**Goal:** Become a habit-builder.

You have now successfully built a habit over a significant period. You're no longer someone trying to start a new routine; you are someone who **knows how to build habits**. This week, it's time to consider adding a new habit to your list.
